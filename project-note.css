/* HELLO , WE ARE PRACTICING THE PROJECTS IN THE COURSE AND TAKING NOTES FROM IT HERE
AND INSIDE OF THE HTML FILE AS WELL

*/



/* CREATING FOLDERS AND FILES FOR A REAL PROJECT : 

THERE IS NORMAL HTML AND CSS WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF ALL OF THE FOLDERS 
AND THERE IS FOLDER NAMED "ASSETS", WHICH BASICALLY CONTAINS IMAGES,FONTS AND THE GRID SYSTEM
THESE HAVE THEIR OWN FOLDERS*/

/* WHEN YOU ARE LINKING YOUR GRID SYSTEM AND NORMAL CSS , MAKE SURE TO LINK THE GRID SYSTEM FIRST SO THAT THE OVERWRITING HAPPENS
 */
 /* YOU HAVE TO LINK "JAVASCRIPT" FILES AT THE END OF THE BODY SO THAT IT HELPS THE PAGE TO LOAD FASTER AND LOADS LATER .
 
 BECAUSE AT FIRST , IF THE JAVASCRIPT LOADS LATE , IT DOESNT MATTER BECUASE THE USER DOESNT REALLY NEED THE JS AT THE FIRST OF HIS VISITING
 THE USUAL NAME IS "MAIN.JS"*/

 /* WHAT ARE HIDDEN CLASSES IN GRID SYSTEM: 
 
 in a web page , for mobile and small devices, we hide unnecessary stuff so that the web page doesnt get crowded in mobile
 
 so thats why we use hidden classe in grid system.
 
 we first specify in what range of device we want it to be hidden (XS-hidden)
 and then add a -hidden to it .
 we put these classes in our normal media queries.
 
 so for example if we want an element to be hidden in extra small screens, we can specify and give the class xs-hidden*/
